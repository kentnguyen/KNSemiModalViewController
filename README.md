This fork lets code clients configure parameters through an `options` dictionary.

Currently supports configuring the following:

- animation duration
- parent alpha
- optional push-back
- shadow opacity

Easily extend this to anything you would want to make configurable. Feel free to submit pull requests.

## UIViewController+KNSemiModal Category

UIViewController+KNSemiModal is an effort to make a replica of **semi-modal view with pushed-back stacked animation** found in the beautiful [Park Guides by National Geographic](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/national-parks-by-national/id518426085?mt=8) app. You can see this original semi-modal view below.

This library (ARC) is designed as a Category to UIViewController so you don't have to subclass and you can simply drop in any project and it will just work!

### Demo

Download a demo clip [here](https://github.com/kentnguyen/KNSemiModalViewController/blob/master/Docs/KNSemiModalDemo.mov?raw=true) (1.3MB, .mov)

### Features
* Works with bare UIViewController
* Works with UIViewController contained inside UINavigationController
* Works with UIViewController contained inside UINavigationController, contained inside UITabbarController
* Auto handling of modal frame size
* Auto handling of touch area for dismissal
* Resizable after presenting so that keyboard related interactions are possible
* Easy to understand and very small code base, only 2 files
* Trivial to implement as subclass
* Only use basic CAAnimation, should work fine with SDK 4.x up.

### TODO
* iPad support (?)
* Landscape support

### Installation / How to use
* `#import "UIViewController+KNSemiModal.h"` in your ViewController
* Call `[self presentSemiModalView:myView]`
